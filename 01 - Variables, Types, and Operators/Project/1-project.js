//Character Generator - Create an app that allows a player to create a tabletop RPG character.
//Characters should have a name, race, class, level, experience points, health points, and stats (Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, etc).
//Level should be calculated based on experience (Level 1: 0 experience, Level 2: 300 experience, etc).
//Health points should be calculated as the product of the current level and a coefficient between 6 and 12.
//Stats should be generated as a value between 4 and 24.
//Log each of the chracters properties (name, race, class, etc).
//Hint:  Use the following to generate values between two numbers - Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min
